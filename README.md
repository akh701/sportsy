# Sportsy

# About

Sportsy is an app for like-minded sports players to meet other people in their local area to play their favourite sports with. Users can browse local sport meet-ups, sign up to an event, join the conversation through individual event comment threads, and make new friends along the way. Anyone can create their own event once registered, view the events they’re hosting or attending, and search through available events based on which sport they’re interested in.
